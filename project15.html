            <p><b>Information: </b> The Ankeny Library wants to be an integral part of the Ankeny community by determining possible gaps in the community and striving to meet those needs if possible.  We would love to have Orbis innovators be creative in helping us identify ways that we could be an even better resource to the community and helping us develop those solutions.

            <p><b>Purpose:</b> We want to be innovative in how to best fulfill our mission (below) and meet the needs of our community.  
The Mission Statement of the Ankeny Library is:  The mission of the Ankeny Kirkendall Public Library is to provide equal access to information, materials and services within an environment that welcomes interaction and personal enrichment for all the people of our community.

Libraries are also a place for people to come together, feel connected, and engage with others. In today's digital age, the Kirkendall Public Library is no longer just a place to check out books. We offer a multitude of services to support our growing community. Whether you are looking for recreation, relaxation or information, we can accommodate you.
